# BlackJack on Javascript  
A basic web application of Blackjack written only with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. This project is inspired from 
<a href="https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v">Per Borgen's Javascript course in Scrimba.<a>

I made a couple of improvements from Per's original Blackjack game as well as add features that were missing.
### Improvements:
1. User Interface
